| Category | Feedback | Points |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| _about.md_ | | |
| • Dataset link | Dataset link is provided in _about.md_ |  |
| • Dataset description | Dataset is described sufficiently | 5/5 |
| • Application description | Application is described sufficiently—classic sports-domain application genre | 5/5 |
| • Choice rationale | Database choice rationale effectively communicates reason for choosing a relational database model | 5/5 |
| • Choice assessment | Database choice assessment is expressed clearly—no wrong or right answer here of course, because it’s all about your view of the decision after the fact | 5/5 |
| _.gitignore_ | _.gitignore_ contains appropriate ignores |  |
| Schema | Schema diagram effectively communicates the intended design of the database, with proper notation of primary and referring keys<br><br>Schema SQL appears to follow the design and executes without errors | 10/10 |
| Preprocessing/loader | Loaders appear to run without issues | 20/20 |
| Indexing | Indexing scheme is sufficiently implemented and documented with both timing and explanation data | 20/20 |
| _setup.md_ | _setup.md_ is accurate, complete, and clear; instructions and results went as documented. Excellent job! | 10/10 |
| DAL module | | |
| • Configuration/setup | Configuration code uses library correctly and properly separates configuration information as an environment variable |  |
| • Featured queries | Featured queries successfully perform their intended queries and include the requested documentation | 20/20 |
| • CRUD + transaction | CRUD functions generally appear to work as expected and include the requested documentation. Transaction is implemented via the `update_player_score` function. Very well done!  | 25/25 |
| • Helpers | Broad range of helper functions here, all appearing to work as expected and including the requested documentation | 15/15 |
| PoC | • _delete_game_.py_, _delete_game_details_.py_, and _update_player_score.py _ check the argument count, provides help when needed, and displays confirmation that operation was successful (–1)<br><br>• _add_game_.py_ checks the argument count, provides help when needed, and displays confirmation that operation was successful, as well as the newly created game ID<br><br>• _players_by_team.py_, _get_count_by_stat_combo.py_,  _get_game_by_id.py_, _get_game_details_by_id.py_,  _get_player_detail.py_, _get_team_id.py_, _search_game_id_, _search_by_stat_combo.py_, checks the argument count, provides help when needed, displays readable and appropriate results for all use cases<br><br>• In general, when given input variables that don’t match type wise (or in the case of _search_by_stat_combo.py_ if you don’t specify the exact shortened form of on of the attributes), your programs end up producing a stack trace (–2) | 17/20 |
| Retrospective | | |
| • _group-retrospective.md_ | _group-retrospective.md_ sounds like it was written by just one person—I guess that’s the story of the semester huh 😆 | 5/5 |
| • Individual email | Credit applied to those who sent an email | |
| Tutorial video | Relational theory sufficiently touched on—“deer in headlights” largely averted 😁 | 30/30 |
| Code maintainability | No major code maintainability issues were found (that weren’t otherwise already pointed out) |  |
| Code readability | No major code readability issues were found (that weren’t otherwise already pointed out) |  |
| Version control | Not a lot of commits given the scope of this assignment, but with sufficiently descriptive messages; all commits are Bryan Madole’s…where is everyone else??? Those slackers |  |
| Punctuality | First commit on 12/10 10:36am; last commit on 12/13 6:33pm<br><br>Accommodated due to time management and workload issues |  |
| | **Total** | **192/195** |
